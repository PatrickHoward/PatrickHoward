## üëã Why hello there!
The name is Patrick (He/Him)! I'm a student at the Universtiy of Akron and a software developer/co-founder with Strife AI LLC. 
My primary work interests are in building games, creating powerful/easy to use tools, iOS apps, WASM apps, and plenty more. I really enjoy programming in Rust ü¶Ä, Swift üçé, and C/C++ üíª. But I have worked in plenty of other languages as well (C#, Objective-C, Java, and Javascript to name a few). Lately my work has largely focused in C++ and Rust.

Outside of programming I do digital creative work such as 3D modeling and animation (Autodesk Maya / Blender), photo manipulation (Adobe Photoshop / Krita), and video editing (Adobe Premiere Pro). As well as plenty of hobbies to keep me occupied such as Swimming, Photography, Coffee, and Travel.

### üì¶ Projects
#### [Plumber](https://github.com/PatrickHoward/plumber) - Quick little tool I'm hacking together right now to help streamline pushing builds to Steam.
#### [Strife.Engine](https://github.com/Strife-AI/Strife.Engine) - 2D Game engine built and optimized for machine learning and artifiical intelligence! Built with [Strife AI](https://github.com/Strife-AI)
#### [HAWKengine/Project SkyHAWK](https://github.com/PatrickHoward/project-skyhawk) - 3D Game engine and game for my upcoming senior project during Spring of 2022. Inspired by Bandai/Namco's Ace Combat series.
#### [Human-Like](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400190/Human-Like) - A platformer-runner that utilizes machine learning to put a robot against the player that learns from the player's actions. The game is available at the link above on Steam! Built with [Strife AI](https://github.com/Strife-AI)
#### [RonaCollege](https://ronacollege.com) Website for forming study groups in the time of COVID-19, I helped continue development on the project and expanded some of the functionality.
#### [Minute To Midnight](https://github.com/PatrickHoward/minute-to-midnight) - A short game for the 2020 UACM Spring Break game jam. The theme was "One minute to win". Minute to midnight is centered around your constantly dimming light that on its own, only lasts a minute.
#### [Scribble](https://github.com/Scribble-Editor) - Built with [Link00000000](https://github.com/link00000000), Scribble is a code-editor for the cloud. It can run a Python interpreter and cross compile C++ code.
#### [Adventure Buddy](https://github.com/PatrickHoward/Adventure-Buddy) - A simple ascii game that uses a Breadth First Search pathfinding algorithm and a finite state machine for AI behavior.

I've also done some school projects that are featured here on my Github.
