## üëã Why hello there!
The name is Patrick (He/Him)! I'm CEO and Director of Experiences at [RustBit Studio](https://rustbit.com) and a student at the Universtiy of Akron. 
My primary work interests are in building games, creating powerful/easy to use tools, Apple-Platform apps, WASM apps, and plenty more. I really enjoy programming in Rust ü¶Ä, Swift üçé, and C/C++ üíª. But I have worked in plenty of other languages as well (C#, Objective-C, Java, and Javascript to name a few). Lately my work has largely focused in C++ and Rust.

Outside of programming I do digital creative work such as 3D modeling and animation (Autodesk Maya / Blender), photo manipulation (Adobe Photoshop / Krita), and video editing (Adobe Premiere Pro). As well as plenty of hobbies to keep me occupied such as Swimming, Photography, Coffee, and Travel.

Feel free to take a look at my [Resume](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/06Kp1PSRpwh-xFHn6TrXHAkVw#PMHResume%5FPublic)

### üì¶ Projects

Built at [RustBit Studio](https://rustbit.com). Check it out on [Steam](https://steam.gripofmandess.com)!
#### Crimson Court - A backstabbing card game with a secret timer built at [RustBit Studio](https://rustbit.com)! I'll be taking care of development and seeing it from inception all the way to a completed game. Planned targets are for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Game design by [BKGameDesign](https://github.com/BKGameDesign) and art by [LexyAlfman](https://github.com/lexyalfman)!
