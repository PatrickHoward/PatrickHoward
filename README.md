## 👋 Why hello there!
The name is Patrick (He/Him)! I'm a student at the Universtiy of Akron and a software developer with Strife AI LLC. 
I'm very interested in systems-level programing, things such as graphics, games, web-backends, operating systems, and more. 
I really enjoy programming in Rust 🦀, Swift 🍎, C/C++ 💻, and Python 🐍. But I have worked in plenty of other languages as well (C#, Objective-C, Java, and Javascript to name a few). Lately my work has largely focused in C++.

Outside of programming I do digital creative work such as 3D modeling and animation (Autodesk Maya), photo manipulation (Adobe Photoshop / Krita), and video editing (Adobe Premiere Pro). 

### 📦 Projects
#### [C.H.A.S.E.R.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400190/CHASER)
Currently I am working with a small team developing C.H.A.S.E.R. a platformer-runner that utilizes machine learning to put a robot against the player that learns from the player's actions. The game is available at the link above on Steam Early Access!

#### [Minute To Midnight](https://github.com/PatrickHoward/minute-to-midnight)
A short game for the 2020 UACM Spring Break game jam. The theme was "One minute to win". Minute to midnight is centered around your constantly dimming light that on its own,
only lasts a minute.

#### [Scribble](https://github.com/Scribble-Editor)
Built with [Link00000000](https://github.com/link00000000), Scribble is a code-editor for the cloud. It can run a Python interpreter and cross compile C++ code.

I've also done some school projects that are featured here on my Github.
